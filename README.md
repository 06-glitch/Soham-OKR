Open MMC → Add Certificates snap-in → Local Computer.

Locate your expired cert under Personal > Certificates.

Renew or import a new certificate:

If using a corporate CA, request a new one.

If using a public CA, upload the CSR, get a cert, and import it.

Bind the new certificate in IIS > Bindings.

Restart IIS:

bash
Copy code
iisreset
Scenario B: Using Apache or Nginx (Linux)
Update your .crt, .key, and .ca-bundle files as mentioned earlier, then restart the service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl reload apache2   # or nginx
Scenario C: Using Load Balancer or Reverse Proxy
If you terminate SSL at a load balancer (like AWS ALB, F5, Azure App Gateway):

Go to the load balancer's SSL settings.

Upload the renewed certificate.

Apply and save the configuration.

Final Checks
Visit https://chemops-cg-resources.mmm.com in a browser to confirm no “Not Secure” warning.

Inform affected users once it’s restored.

If you provide:

Web server or hosting environment

Whether internal CA or external certificate authority

OS (Linux or Windows)

…I can give exact commands/config steps.

Great question.

🧾 What is IIS?
IIS stands for Internet Information Services. It is a web server created by Microsoft that runs on Windows Server operating systems.

🔧 What Does IIS Do?
IIS is used to:

Host websites and web applications (like .NET, HTML, PHP)

Manage HTTPS/SSL certificates

Serve static and dynamic content

Configure bindings for custom domains (e.g., chemops-cg-resources.mmm.com)

Handle authentication, logging, and URL rewriting

🖥️ Where You’ll Find IIS
You’ll typically see IIS in:

Corporate intranet environments

Windows Server setups

Applications written in ASP.NET or used with Microsoft ecosystems

🛠️ Common IIS Tools
If you're managing a Windows server, you might use:

IIS Manager (GUI): for configuring sites, certificates, bindings

PowerShell: to script deployments or renewals

MMC (Microsoft Management Console): for handling certificates

🧪 How to Check If a Server Uses IIS
If you have access to the server, go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > IIS Manager, or run:

bash
Copy code
inetmgr
Or check HTTP response headers in the browser or with curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -I https://yourdomain.com
If you see something like:

arduino
Copy code
Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0
…then the server is running IIS.

If you're unsure whether your site is hosted on IIS or something else, I can help you figure it out—just let me know what kind of access or tools you have.

Certificates

Device Manager

Group Policy

Services

Disk Management

Event Viewer

It’s especially useful for administrators who want centralized access to tools.

📌 How to Open MMC
Press Windows + R

Type: mmc

Hit Enter

You’ll see a blank console.

➕ How to Add Snap-ins (e.g., Certificates)
In MMC, go to File > Add/Remove Snap-in

Choose a snap-in, such as Certificates

Click Add, then choose:

My user account

Service account

Computer account (used for server certificates)

Click Finish > OK

✅ Common Use Case: Fixing Certificates
To renew or replace SSL certificates on a Windows server:

Open MMC

Add the Certificates snap-in for Computer account

Navigate to Certificates (Local Computer) > Personal > Certificates

Find the expired cert and renew or replace it

Let me know if you want a step-by-step with screenshots or commands based on your server type.
